            the journey and protect our products from potential damage, we make sure that they are packed sufficiently.
          </p>
          <p>Our prices don't include shipping costs. They will be added to your order during checkout. Please note that

        <h4 class="delivery__title">Taxes and Customs duties</h4>
        <div class="delivery__text">
          <p>If your delivery country charges local taxes or customs duties - these will be charged once the package
            reaches the destination country. You will have to pay these charges. This also applies to the purchase of
            gifts or other purchases made on behalf of another recipient.
            Unfortunately, we have no control over customs fees and we cannot inform you how much they will be before
            you order. Customs policies vary widely from country to country. Please contact your local customs office
            for further information.</p>

        <div class="delivery__text">
          <p>You may change your mind within 14 days of receiving your items. You have to notify us before the 14 days
            if you want to return your order. Please contact us at: <a
              href="mailto:info@noom-home.com">info@noom-home.com</a>
            After you have received the items you ordered, you may carefully examine and try the items within the period
            of 14 days, but only in a manner as you would if you examined the products in our store or any other offline
            reseller. If the items or packing have been used in excess of what is normal in order to examine them, you
            will be held liable for the decrease in value of the items the use has caused. When we have received the
            items, we will notify you if there is any loss of value of the product and if your refund will be lower than
            the price paid.
            If we accept your return order as valid and the product can be re-sold as new, you will be entitled to
            receive an exchange or a refund, which will not include the expenses on back and forth logistics. The refund
            will be paid back within 14 days of receiving the notification of your wish to return the order. However the
            refund will not be paid before we have received the items at our warehouse.
            It is not possible to return made to order product, that are produced according to your specific choices of
            fabric and color. Therefore, we are unable to offer a refund or an exchange for NOOM furniture once the
            order has been made.</p>
