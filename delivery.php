        <p>For international shipments, we use proven freight forwarders such as TNT, DHL or UPS. In order to handle
          the journey and protect our products from potential damage, we make sure that they are packed sufficiently.
        </p>
        <p>Our prices don't include shipping costs. They will be added to your order during checkout. Please note that
          shipping estimates for large and bulky products are indicative only. For an accurate shipping calculation

      <h4 class="delivery__title">Taxes and Customs duties</h4>
      <div class="delivery__text">
        <p>If your delivery country charges local taxes or customs duties - these will be charged once the package
          reaches the destination country. You will have to pay these charges. This also applies to the purchase of
          gifts or other purchases made on behalf of another recipient.
          Unfortunately, we have no control over customs fees and we cannot inform you how much they will be before
          you order. Customs policies vary widely from country to country. Please contact your local customs office
          for further information.</p>

      <h4 class="delivery__title">Returns</h4>
      <div class="delivery__text">
        <p>You may change your mind within 14 days of receiving your items. You have to notify us before the 14 days
          if you want to return your order. Please contact us at: <a href="mailto:info@noom-home.com">info@noom-home.com</a>
          After you have received the items you ordered, you may carefully examine and try the items within the period
          of 14 days, but only in a manner as you would if you examined the products in our store or any other offline
          reseller. If the items or packing have been used in excess of what is normal in order to examine them, you
          will be held liable for the decrease in value of the items the use has caused. When we have received the
          items, we will notify you if there is any loss of value of the product and if your refund will be lower than
          the price paid.
          If we accept your return order as valid and the product can be re-sold as new, you will be entitled to
          receive an exchange or a refund, which will not include the expenses on back and forth logistics. The refund
          will be paid back within 14 days of receiving the notification of your wish to return the order. However the
          refund will not be paid before we have received the items at our warehouse.
          It is not possible to return made to order product, that are produced according to your specific choices of
          fabric and color. Therefore, we are unable to offer a refund or an exchange for NOOM furniture once the
          order has been made.</p>
